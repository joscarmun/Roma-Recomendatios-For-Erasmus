      <h2>Finding a place to stay in Rome</h2>
      <p>Rome is one of the most chosen cities by foreign students to live an academic experience. Living in Rome means living a very enriching cultural experience, but first you must find suitable accommodation for your stay.
        The best advice is to start looking as soon as possible, usually there are few flats and they are very expensive, I’m sorry to say that it’s hard to find a flat for less than 500 or 600 euros.
        To make the search more pleasant, we recommend that you ask people who are in Rome at that moment, join WhatsApp groups or ask through social media. Be careful with scams and make sure that the flat you are renting is real.
        The best neighbourhoods to live in, either because they are close to the uni or have good connections with metro and buses, are the area of Piazza Bologna, the San Lorenzo neighbourhood, Trieste (especially if you’re going to La Sapienza University), Ostiense, Garbatella (if you’re going to Roma Tre), Prati (for Lumsa).</p>
